# Week 17 Challenge


## React Todo App


### Project Instructions

In this challenge we will create a Todo list application using React.

This application will have three components:
- App
- TodoForm
- Todos

## App Component

The App component should be your top level component. It will be responsible for rendering the TodoForm and the Todos components.  It will also be responsible for keeping track of all the todos.

## TodoForm Component

The TodoForm component should render the form to create a new todo item.  On form submittal, the todo item needs to be stored in the App component

## Todos Component

The Todos component should iterate over all of the todo items and render the `title` and `content` of each todo item.

To start install the necessary packages, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` to start the application.
